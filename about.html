				<p> "PWTF" or "perry.wtf" is a long-term project started by me, Brett Perry. </p>
				<p>I was born in Australia on Sept. 1st, 1995. I became obsessed with creating things at an early age. At first I wanted to create things using my hands and manual labor, but I soon lost motivation on anything like carpentry or metalwork. It wasn't until I turned 18, with my obsession for music now deeply embedded into my soul that I realized I should actually try making my own tunes.  </p>
				<p> Of course at first they were terrible, but it quickly became the one thing I couldn't put down. Along with art and writing, these outlets now fuel and satisfy my obsession for creativity; and keep me pretty busy. </p>
				<p> PWTF is essentially a place where I can store all of my creative belongings, such as my writing, my art, and especially my music. It's become a place that will forever be something I can say I'm proud of, regardless of its success. I try and will continue to try to keep PWTF alive with new things every <s>week</s> <s>month</s> year. Hopefully.</p>
